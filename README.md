# 🎲 Casino Dice Game DApp

## Project Vision

To create a transparent, decentralized casino gaming platform that eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries while providing provably fair gaming experiences. Our vision is to revolutionize online gambling by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and fairness for all players.

## Project Description

The Casino Dice Game DApp is a smart contract-based gambling platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. Players can deposit ETH, place bets on dice roll outcomes, and withdraw their winnings in a completely decentralized manner. The game uses a simple prediction mechanism where players bet on whether a dice roll (1-6) will be higher than their chosen prediction number (1-5).

The smart contract handles all game logic, maintains player balances, tracks game history, and ensures fair payouts with a transparent house edge system. All transactions and game results are recorded on the blockchain, providing complete transparency and immutability.
